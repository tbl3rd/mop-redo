* Implement a novel data structure using a common methodology^H^H^H^H^H.

This is an implementation of a novel data structure called "The Mop"
invented by some Eagle Scouts.  All credit goes to Mat, Chuck, and
Steve, who had the idea and explained it.  I am just a Cub Scout who
"Finally Understands Basic Algorithms Reluctantly".

* The F.U.B.A.R. Methodology^H^H^H^H^H

I often use the FUBAR method to implement novel data structures, such
as The Mop, when faced with some problem that might be solved by a ...
novel data structure.  Actually, FUBAR is useful for many software
tasks.  What can be said for it?  Well, it works.  And I believe it is
the methodology^H^H^H^H^H used by most programmers -- at least those
who aren't Eagle Scouts.
